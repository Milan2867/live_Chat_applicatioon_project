This is a simple interactive, multithreaded Client-Server chat application developed using Java. The application allows multiple clients to connect to a server and send messages to each other in real-time.

# Prerequisites
Java 8 or later must be installed on your system.

# Running the application
Clone this repo to your local machine and open the project in your favourite IDE or simply navigate to the project folder from command line.
Start the server by running the Server.java file and follow the prompt.
Start the client by running the Client.java file. You can start as many clients as you want. Enter the same port number of the server when prompted on the client side.
Once connected to the server, you can start sending messages to other connected clients.
